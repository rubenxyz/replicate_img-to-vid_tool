# Code Cleanup Tasks - 2025-09-18

## ✅ CLEANUP COMPLETED

### Completion Summary
- **Status**: All critical tasks completed
- **Files Modified**: 3 files (processor.py, verbose_processor.py)
- **Lines Changed**: ~25 lines
- **Tests Passed**: ✅ All imports work, application runs successfully

### Tasks Completed

#### Critical Fixes
- [x] **[FIXED]** Added missing `_generate_and_download_video()` function to processor.py
  - The function was referenced but not defined, causing a critical error
  - Added implementation that calls Replicate API and downloads the video

- [x] **[REFACTOR]** Consolidated duplicate `prepare_params` logic
  - Refactored `_prepare_params_verbose()` to reuse `_prepare_generation_params()` from processor.py
  - Eliminated code duplication while preserving verbose logging functionality

- [x] **[CLEANUP]** Removed unused imports from verbose_processor.py
  - Removed BaseVideoProcessor import (no longer needed after refactor)
  - Removed duration_handler imports (now imported via processor module)

### Verification Results
- [x] **Python syntax check**: `python -m py_compile src/**/*.py` ✅ No errors
- [x] **Import test (main)**: `from src.main import main` ✅ Success
- [x] **Import test (verbose)**: `from src.main_verbose import main` ✅ Success  
- [x] **Application test**: `./run.py` ✅ Runs successfully (tested with real video generation)

### Notes
- Most unused imports identified in the cleanup report were already removed in previous sessions
- The TYPE_CHECKING import in video_processing.py is correctly used to prevent circular imports
- Code quality improved through consolidation of duplicate logic
